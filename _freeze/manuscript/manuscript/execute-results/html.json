However, Queen’s is not served by regular municipal waste collection. What municipal collection that is done is ad-hoc, sporadic, and based on the hospital’s available financial resources. Rather, most hospital waste (infectious and non-infectious) is gathered by grounds staff and openly burned, in several constantly smouldering piles, sending up clouds of smoke.  Speaking directly to an identified knowledge gap on air quality impacts linked to trash burning and the paucity of African urban dwellers’ voices on air quality issues, this study employed a mixed-methods approach to both quantitatively measure the air quality around QECH, and to qualitatively investigate the perceived impacts amongst staff and caregivers. Low-cost sensors measuring particulate matter (PM) with particle sizes less than 10 µm (PM~10~) and less than 2.5 µm (PM~2.5~), expressed as the mass of PM per volume of air (µg PMx/m^3^ air) were recorded every 5 minutes at 8 locations across the QECH for 2 months. Qualitative data collection consisted of 56 interviews with patients, caregivers and hospital staff (including janitorial and maintenance staff, nurses, doctors, and administrators).  Our results show that safe air quality thresholds are consistently exceeded across space and time and that the most problematic air quality surrounds the shelter for caregivers and those receiving treatment for HIV/AIDs. Moreover, staff and visitors are severely impacted by the poor air quality within the space, but  feel powerless to make changes or address complaints. Waste management interventions are desperately needed lest the patients who arrive at Queen’s leave with more health issues than the ones with which they arrived. \nkeywords: \n  - waste management\n  - healthcare waste\n  - trash burning\n  - air quality\n  - Malawi\n  - urbanisation\ndate: last-modified\nbibliography: [man-qechairquality.bib, packages.bib]\nformat:\n  docx: default\n  html: default\n  elsevier-pdf:\n    keep-tex: true\n    journal:\n      name: Habitat International\n      formatting: review\n      model: 3p\n      cite-style: authoryear\n      highlights:\n        - Low-cost monitors were used to assess air quality at Malawi’s largest hospital\n        - Open waste burning is physically extensive and temporally frequent across the hospital campus\n        - Air quality measured as PM~2.5~ and PM~10~ consistently exceeded even the most hazardous levels \n        - The most exposed locations were where guardians of patients stay and the HIV clinic\nexecute: \n  echo: false\n  warning: false\n  freeze: true\neditor: \n  markdown: \n    wrap: 72\neditor_options: \n  chunk_output_type: console\n---\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n# Introduction\n\nBuilt in 1964, Malawi's year of independence, Queen Elizabeth Central\nHospital (QECH), or Queen's, as it's known locally, is the country's\nlargest public hospital. Designed in the Tropical Modernism style of\narchitecture popular within Africa in the late colonial period, Queen's\nopen-plan form sprawls across a broad swath of central Blantyre, with\ndozens of wards, specialised facilities, and administrative buildings,\nlinked together by a bewildering maze of covered walkways. A hive of\naround-the-clock activity, Queen's bustles from dawn to dusk with a\nconstant stream of patients, drawn from across the country, and\nmaintains a city-like feel even after dark as staff and stay-in family\nmembers cook and care for their in-patient dependants. Yet, for the\nfirst-time visitor, it's not the architecture or the crowds that are the\nmost striking when entering the grounds, but the smell. Immediately\nnoticeable, even from the road outside the hospital, Queen's is\nsmothered by an acrid-smelling, white smoke, which hangs over the\ngrounds day and night: the product of several constantly burning fires\nspread across the campus. Breathing this air, when a significant amount\nof burning is occurring, primarily at night when the smoke is less\nvisible, can be incredibly uncomfortable. Moreover, the tropical\narchitecture, designed to let air and light circulate, means that even\nindoors, within patient wards, surgery, and treatment areas, the air\nquality can also be unbearable. Poor air quality associated with\nburning, through released particulate matter (PM), has been linked to\nmultiple negative health outcomes like asthma, heart disease, heart\nfailure, stroke, and cancer among others [@anderson2012clearing;\n@bell2012assessment]. In a space of healing and recovery, why is such\nburning occurring, and how can it continue to persist?\n\nQueen's, simply, produces an immense amount of waste that it is unable\nto efficiently manage. The dozens of wards, offices, and kitchens,\nserving the hundreds of patients and staff, generates considerable\ninfectious medical waste, mixed domestic and office waste, and kitchen\nwaste, which needs to be removed and disposed of daily. Some individual\nwards implement waste separation, binning medical wastes separately from\ngeneral waste, however separation ends at the point of collection.\nQueen's is not served by regular municipal waste collection. What\nmunicipal collection that is done is ad-hoc, sporadic, and based on the\nhospital's available financial resources. Rather, most hospital waste\n(infectious and non-infectious) is gathered by grounds staff and burnt\nat the hospital's incinerator, located at a central point within the\nhospital campus[^1] [@kalina2020this]. However, the vast majority of the\ndeposited waste is not incinerated, as a new incinerator provided by the\nMinistry of Health in late 2019, is only able to handle a small\npercentage of the hospital's waste. Furthermore, the incinerator is\nfrequently inoperable, under repair, or without power[^2]. Rather, the\nwaste is openly burned, in a constantly smouldering pile to the side of\nthe incinerator building, sending up the aforementioned clouds of smoke,\nwhich choke the grounds (@fig-open-burning). Innumerable other, smaller,\nfires, scattered across the QECH campus (@fig-map-sensors) contribute\ntheir part, as grounds and maintenance staff habitually burn leaves and\nother garden refuse. Furthermore, caregivers[^3] who reside separately\non hospital grounds, cook for themselves throughout the day and night\nusing biomass (charcoal or wood), and burn their own domestic waste. As\na result, air quality at the hospital is a constant source of\ndiscussion, with patients, staff, and caregivers struggling to cope,\nwhen just breathing is, as the quote[^4] used in the title of this\narticle, 'unbearable.'\n\n[^1]: Sharps are handled and disposed of separately.\n\n[^2]: There was an older incinerator on the grounds which failed in\n    2017. Between 2017 and 2021, when the new incinerator was\n    commissioned, nothing was incinerated at all.\n\n[^3]: Patients are required to bring a caregiver for in-patient\n    hospitals stays, usually a family member, who assist with feeding,\n    bathing, and all other non-medical services.\n\n[^4]: ID5, 2019-11-18\n\nChallenges with solid waste management (SWM) are not unique to Queen's,\nand remain persistent globally, particularly within African nations, and\nthe Global South more broadly [@bundhoo2018solid;\n@sergekubanza2022exploring; @muheirwe2022paradox; @srivastava2015urban].\nExplanations for these disparities have centred on the on waste\ngeneration outstripping waste management infrastructure\n[@muheirwe2022paradox], and the high costs of waste management systems,\nwhich often prove unaffordable for many low-and-middle-income countries\n(LMICs) [@guerrero2013solid; @sergekubanza2022exploring]. Waste\ncollection is an important step within SWM systems, and is a common\nbarrier within LMIC contexts [@bundhoo2018solid]. Waste inequalities\nbetween high-income countries (HICs) and low-income countries (LICs) is\noften most pernicious and visible at the point of collection, with some\nHICs achieving 100% collection rates, while some African nations have\nrates well below 50% [@shi2021unbalanced]. Inequalities persist beyond\ncollection, however. Even once waste is collected, municipalities in\nLMICs may burn or dump it in non-sanitary landfills due to the absence\nof further treatment or disposal options [@cook2021globala]. According\nto @kaza2018what, 90% of waste in LIC is disposed of in unregulated\ndumps or openly burned, while the quantity of waste generation in these\ncountries is expected to triple by 2050. As a result, open waste\nburning, in nations like Malawi, can be expected to become more\nprevalent.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Open burning at QECH, with the old incinerator building in the background (Authors).](img/open-waste-burning-incinerator-qech.jpg){#fig-open-burning fig-align='center' width=80%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAlthough hospital waste is among the common types of solid waste openly\nburned in LICs (in addition to municipal solid waste, sewage sludge,\nmarket or commercial waste, agricultural residues), the open burning of\nhospital waste has not garnered as much discussion as the burning of\nother waste fractions [@cook2021globala]. The World Health Organisation\n(WHO) defines hospital, or health-care waste, as waste generated by\nhealth-care activities, of which approximately 85% is general,\nnon-hazardous waste, but the remaining 15% can be considered hazardous,\nand may be toxic, infectious, or radioactive. These infectious fractions\nare commonly incinerated in both high and middle-income countries,\nhowever in the absence of capacity, or costly incineration or autoclave\ninfrastructure, open burning is often a last resort option for disposal\nin LIC contexts [@who2018healthcare]. The open burning of biomedical\nwaste may reduce infection risk from potentially harmful pathogens,\nhowever, such waste may contain sharps, radioactive waste,\nmercury-containing instruments, and plastics, the open burning of which\nmay result in the emission of dioxins, furans, and toxic particulate\nmatter (PM) [@who2018healthcare; @cook2021globala].\n\nPoor air quality in in African cities can be attributed to multiple\nfactors, including vehicular emissions, dust, or the use of low-quality\nfuels for cooking, lighting, and heating, however, the open burning of\nwaste has been identified as one of the key contributors to air\npollution within urban areas [@amegah2018proliferation;\n@bulto2020impact]. Although open trashing burning is a problem in LICs\nbroadly, for instance, @wiedinmyer2014global estimate that open trash\nburning contributes to 29% of the total global PM~2.5~ anthropogenic\nemissions, it is of particular concern in Sub-Saharan African (SSA)\ncities, which are home to 19 of the world's 50 biggest dumpsites (United\nNations Development Programme, 2021). Particulate matter, or PM, is not\nspecific to trash burning, but rather the product of any type of\nincomplete combustion and is one of the most commonly measured\nindicators for air quality. PM is measured in terms of its particle size\nand generally classified into PM with particle sizes less than 10 µm\n(PM~10~) and those with sizes less than 2.5 µm (PM~2.5~), while one way\nof measuring the severity of air pollution is by expressing the mass of\nPM per volume of air (µg PMx/m^3^ air). PM has been linked to multiple\nnegative health outcomes. Amongst particulate air pollution, PM~10~ and\nPM~2.5~ are of particular concern as they can penetrate deep into the\nlungs, and their exposure has been associated with asthma, heart\ndisease, heart failure, stroke, and cancer [@mohapatra2014effect;\n@xing2016impact]. As a result, the health impacts of ambient air\nparticle pollution may be significant, especially for the most\nvulnerable. For instance, the @ihme2019ambient estimates PM related air\npollution resulted in 4.14 million deaths worldwide (in 2019), of which,\n394,000 occurred in Africa. Yet, despite its importance, the air quality\nand health picture in Africa is worryingly incomplete. For instance, the\nWHO only collects data from 10 African countries (covering 39 cities)\n[@worldhealthorganization2016ambient]. Likewise, robust, epidemiological\ndata from and for the African context is also lacking, though emerging\ndata suggests strong correlations between PM and poor health outcomes\n[@coker2018narrative; @heft-neal2018robust]. Moving forward, it is not\njust the air at Queen's which lacks clarity.\n\nUtilising a mixed-methods approach, including a network of\ncustom-designed air quality monitors and qualitative fieldwork with\nhospital staff, patients, and caregivers, the purpose of this\ninvestigation was to gain a multi-dimensional understanding of the\nimpacts of the open burning of the various solid and organic waste\nfractions at QECH. Specifically, this work aimed to intensively and\nlongitudinally measure the air quality, in particulate matter (PM), at\nmultiple locations at and surrounding the central burning point.\nFurthermore, we also aimed to qualitatively understand how affected\nindividuals perceive air quality at QECH and understand potential health\nimpacts.\n\nThis research responds to a several specific gaps within the body of\nacademic air quality literature: Although there has been ample\ndiscussion of air quality challenges in African cities\n[@mbow-diokhane2019air; @miralvarez2020scoping; @petkova2013particulate;\n@singh2021aira], there is a paucity of data on air quality impacts\nlinked to trash burning. In particular, within African cities, there has\nbeen a total dearth of scholarship on the burning of medical waste, or\non air quality within hospital contexts. Furthermore, while the voices\nof the citizens of Northern cities [@deguen2012new; @howel2002urban;\n@reames2019people] have been well documented on localised air quality\nissues, the voices of African urban dwellers have not been given the\nsame consideration, and there remains a pressing need to understand how\nthese populations experience the impacts of the open burning of trash\nwithin their communities and understand potential risks.\n\nFindings suggest that particulate matter concentrations are routinely\nabove the WHO guidelines and are especially worrisome at several\nlocations. Over the course of the two-month study, the hazardous limits\nfor both PM~10~ and PM~2.5~ were exceeded at all locations except for\nthe Lions Sight hospital. The limits were exceeded fewer than 50 times\nat five of the locations, but the monitors at the Lighthouse Clinic and\nthe Guardian Shelter recorded more than 50 instances above the hazardous\nlimits. The extremely hazardous air quality at the Guardian shelter is\nmostly from cooking over open fires, while the PM at the Lighthouse\nClinic is a function of being located directly adjacent to the\nsmouldering waste pile.\n\nInterviews show that patients, staff, and caregivers alike, are keenly\naware that the air quality at Queen's is poor, with most respondents\nreporting frequent respiratory-related illness. Many also linked the\nsmoke to potential long-term health complications and expressed a belief\nthat the pollution could be contributing to other, more potentially\nlife-threatening diseases, such as asthma, cancer, and tuberculosis.\nMoreover, the tropical design of hospital buildings have rendered most\ncoping mechanisms ineffective, with most staff only finding relief at\nhome: relief that is not available to the hundreds of patients and\ncaregivers who sleep at QECH or are unable to leave.\n\nIn many contexts, waste burning is a necessary, but sporadic event with\nlimited exposure. However, in the context of a large hospital, serving\nthe sickest and poorest, this study shows that the consistent, and\nhighly toxic smoke produced is an unrelenting and unnecessary burden\nthat must be addressed, lest the patients leave in worse condition than\nin which they arrived.\n\n# Material and methods\n\nThis study utilised a mixed-methods approach to both quantitatively\nmeasure the air quality at eight locations around QECH, and to\nqualitatively investigate the perceived impacts amongst staff and\ncaregivers. Although the work was conducted over one sustained period in\nlate 2019, it must be contextualised within five years' experience of\nresearch and activism within QECH by the authors. All relevant\npermissions were obtained from QECH beforehand, through consultations\nwith administration and staff, and the research was approved by the\nNational Committee On Research in The Social Sciences And Humanities in\nMalawi, Protocol NO. P.03/19/356.\n\n## Study site\n\nThe sensors were located within the QECH campus in consultation with\nhospital management. The goal was to locate sensors across the campus\nwith a range of distances and directions from the incinerator, though\nthe final decision was based on accessibility, the permission of the\nunit's head, and convenience. Each of the locations is briefly described\nbelow and shown in Figure 2:\n\n-   **Lions Sight First Eye Hospital**, often shortened to **Lions\n    Sight**, is the largest eye hospital in Malawi and serves as the\n    main teaching eye hospital for the Kamuzu University of Health\n    Sciences (formerly College of Medicine). It is staffed by 5\n    consultants and a team of clinical officers and nurses. It provides\n    a mix of public (no cost) and private (at cost) services.\n\n-   **The Blantyre Malaria Project (BMP)**, established by Professors\n    Terrie Taylor and Malcolm Molyneux, has carried out clinical\n    research and patient care in the area of paediatric malaria,\n    specifically cerebral malaria, for more than 30 years[^5]. Its\n    research infrastructure includes an administrative team, an\n    inpatient research ward, an MRI centre, and an outpatient research\n    clinic in Ndirande township and in other districts outside of\n    Blantyre.\n\n-   **Ward 6B** is a male ward for trauma and orthopaedic patients. It\n    was established as part of the original hospital design. It is a\n    60-bed ward with a dedicated nursing station and treatment rooms.\n\n-   **The Blantyre Lighthouse Trust Clinic**, also known as **Umodzi\n    Family Centre** or simply, the **Lighthouse Clinic**, is one of four\n    operating across Malawi. The clinics work in collaboration with the\n    Ministry of Health (MOH) to provide integrated HIV testing,\n    treatment and care for people living with HIV.\n\n-   The **Moyo Nutritional Rehabilitation and Research Unit**, known on\n    campus as **uMoyo**, is a 57-bed nutritional rehabilitation unit\n    (NRU) for treating infants and children with severe malnutrition and\n    acute illnesses. It is one of 104 operational NRUs in Malawi. It\n    also has an outpatient therapeutic feeding program (OTP) for\n    children with malnutrition who can be treated outside of the\n    hospital.\n\n-   **Mercy James Institute for Pediatric Surgery and Intensive Care\n    (MJC)**, shortened on campus to **Mercy James**, was opened in 2017\n    by the NGO Raising Malawi, which was founded by Madonna. With 3\n    operating rooms and 50 beds, it is the first and only first\n    dedicated paediatric surgery hospital in Malawi. Prior to its\n    opening, QECH had fewer than 10 intensive care beds.\n\n-   The **Administration Building** is the operational hub of the\n    campus, containing mostly offices and meeting rooms.\n\n-   When a patient arrives at QECH, she or he will usually arrive with a\n    guardian: someone to cook for them, buy medicine, do their laundry,\n    and help them bathe. The **Guardian Shelter** is a gender-separated\n    concrete floor shelter for sleeping along with a cooking pavilion\n    and toilet/shower block are maintained by a the local NGO Chira\n    fund. Though simple, the facility is secure and offers one of the\n    only free/accessible toilet facilities for visitors on the QECH\n    campus.\n\n[^5]: BMP is credited with the development of the Blantyre Coma Score,\n    which is used widely.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Sensor locations within QECH](figs/map-sensores-qech-blantyre.png){#fig-map-sensors fig-align='center' width=80%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Waste management\n\nAs the largest public hospital in the country, Queen's produces an\nimmense amount of waste. Hospital staff, such as doctors and nurses,\nprimarily generate and handle medical waste (dry, wet, sharps), which is\ndisposed of in separate waste bins labelled accordingly within the ward.\nHospital visitors (caretakers and patients) generate food waste and are\nadvised by staff to discard such waste in waste bins outside, on\nhospital grounds. Cleaning staff are responsible for emptying bins and\nmaintaining the cleanliness of indoor and outdoor spaces. Collected bags\nare temporarily stored in the sluice room, and cleaners during the night\nshift are responsible for transporting the waste on wheelchairs or\ntrolleys to the incinerator for burning by waste disposers.\n\nYet, according to respondents and our own observations, waste management\nprocedures within the hospital are fraught with challenges which impact\nthe implementation of best practices. These include the lack of a\ncoherent hospital-wide waste management policy, insufficient waste\nmanagement training for staff, and a persistent lack of material and\nfinancial resources. For instance, although hospital administration was\nable to articulate a set of standard operating principles (SOPs) for\nwaste management, below the administration, doctors and nurses were\ngenerally limited in their understanding about its contents.\nFurthermore, cleaners, who are responsible for day-to-day cleansing and\nwaste disposal, yet rate at the bottom of the institutional hierarchy at\nQueens, were unable to access or analyse hospital policy, and generally\ntended to rely on, what one cleaner[^6] described as, \"experience\" and\n\"human judgement\" when handling potentially hazardous waste. Moreover,\nalthough nearly all doctors and nurses had prior education on waste\nmanagement best practices, cleaners began their waste handling duties\nwithout any prior waste management experience, and although there is an\norientation programme for new hires, there is no regular refresher\ntraining or capacity building regarding waste for existing staff, at any\nlevel.\n\n[^6]: ID44, 2021-01-18\n\nDespite its national prominence, and international reputation for\nacademic medical research, Queen's is plagued by constant shortages of\nhuman and material resources. Yet, these shortages are not shared\nequally across the space, with a sharp division in cleanliness,\nresources, and quality of care between public wards, supported by the\nMalawi Ministry of Health, and the private wads with international\nfunding, such as the aforementioned Mercy James Institute. For staff,\nthese shortages have manifested in poor salaries, missed pay cheques,\nfailing infrastructure and limited supplies [@kalina2020this]. Regarding\nwaste management, these shortages have manifested in a chronic shortage\nof black bags, waste containers and cleaning staff. As a result, due to\na lack of bags and storage containers, there is minimal segregation of\nwaste, and highly infectious items (bandages, gloves, syringes, and\nother sharps) are disposed of along with non-hazardous waste (food,\nnewspapers, packaging). As a result, rather than facilitating different\ndisposal pathways for hazardous and non-hazardous waste, all waste is\nmixed, necessitating more burning than would be necessary if\nnon-hazardous waste was diverted, and contributing to workplace risk,\nwith reports of accidental exposure to potentially infected waste,\nincluding accidental pokes from improperly disposed of sharps, common\namongst hospital staff. Regardless, separation ends at the point of\ncollection. The hospital is not serviced by regular municipal waste\ncollection, and as a result, nearly all of the waste produced by the\nhospital, hazardous and non-hazardous, has to be disposed of on-site,\neither within the limited capacity of the hospital incinerator, or more\ncommonly, through open burning. As a result, the constantly smouldering\npile of waste puts forth a continuous cloud of grey smoke, which\nmingling with the dozens of other fires on the grounds, from cooking\nfires and burning garden waste, blankets Queen's in a permanent cloud of\nfoul smelling haze.\n\n## Measuring Air Quality\n\n### Hardware and Software\n\nThe PM monitoring device centres around a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B\nsingle-board computer complete with an operating system and storage\nspace. The added advantage of storage space is that the data are not\nlost if the internet connection breaks down. Because the Pi can only\nread digital signals, we needed to include an analogue-to-digital (ADC)\nconverter. The amount of dust is measured by a Nova PM SDS011 High\nPrecision Laser sensor. This sensor measures particles at 2.5 and 10 µm\nin diameter in mg/m^3^. A list of the specific hardware and software\ncomponents can be found in Appendix B.\n\n### Installation\n\nThe choice of where the sensors were installed was done in collaboration\nwith the QECH administration, but the position of the sensors at the\nindividual buildings were decided by the research team. Four air quality\nsensors were installed on the outside of buildings (Guardian Shelter,\nMercy James, Malaria Project, Lighthouse Clinic) while the remaining\nfour sensors were installed inside (Ward 6B, Administration, Lions\nSight, uMoyo). All of the sensors were mounted to a wall at a height of\napproximately two metres from the ground with the help of QECH\nmaintenance department personnel. This height was chosen to prevent the\npublic from tampering with the equipment when they visit the hospital.\nAdditionally, we assured that each pipe that inhaled ambient air was\nfreely protruding in the building (room) in order to capture the air\nquality.\n\nBecause connecting each unit to a power supply was not possible, each\nunit was equipped with an external battery (5000 mAh) which powered the\nsensor unit for three days continuously. To avoid any down time, we\nchanged the batteries every two days. Data were also collected from the\nsensor at the time of battery replacement. The sensors were capable of\nbeing connected to Wi-Fi, a feature which enabled wireless data access.\n\n### Qualitative Methods\n\nQualitative data collection consisted of 25 interviews with caregivers\nand hospital staff (including janitorial and maintenance staff, nurses,\ndoctors, and administrators) conducted in October and November 2019, as\nwell as an additional 31 interviews conducted with staff, patients, and\ncaregivers in January and February 2021, spread around the hospital's\nvarious wards and departments. Interviews were semi-structured, and\nincluded questions on hospital waste management practices, perceived\nbest practices, and workplace health, safety, and risk. The first round\nof interviews included specific questions on air quality, while the\nsecond round focused on waste management more broadly. However, the\nsemi-structured nature of the interviews allowed for the participants to\nraise topics of interest, and for unexpected themes to emerge. These\ninterviews are supplemented by participatory observation recorded within\ndetailed field notes, and supported by nearly a decade of sustained\ninvolvement and activism by the authors in the waste management\npractices of the hospital.\n\nInterview respondents were chosen using a purposive or judgement\nsampling regimen, i.e. a subjective sampling method in which respondents\nare selected based on their ability to effectively contribute to the\nstudy's research objectives [@kitchin2013conducting]. All respondents\nwere purposively selected based on availability, willingness to provide\nwritten, informed consent, and their individual insight into the\nquestions posed within the study. Interviews were conducted in the local\nlanguage (Chichewa), audio recorded, and transcribed into English.\nParticipation was voluntary, and responses were recorded anonymously.\nWritten, informed consent was obtained from each respondent prior to the\ninterview. The study was approved by the National Committee on Research\nin the Social Sciences and Humanities (NCRSH) of Malawi; Protocol NO.\nP.03/19/356. Collected data were analysed thematically and was coded\nwithin the software programme Nvivo, which organises materials and\nassists with the coding process.\n\n### Limitations\n\nThough extensive and useful in understanding the conditions at QECH, the\ndata set would benefit from a comparison with background values. As\ntrash-burning is extensive throughout the city, there were no obvious\nlocations that could be confidently used as representative background\nvalues. And although there were several possible areas upwind and\noutside of town, the logistics and safety involved in accessing them to\nchange the batteries meant that the measured values at Queens could not\nbe compared to a stable background concentration. Knowing the wind\ndirection and velocity would have helped in better identifying the\npotential sources of the measured PM. However, the necessary equipment\nwas not easily available in Blantyre at the time, and as an exploratory\nstudy, the immediate hazards for the staff and patients at QECH are\nrelevant regardless of the burning source.\n\nKnowing the exact burning locations and burning times, especially at the\nincinerator and the Guardian Shelter, would have helped in better\nidentifying the sources and movements of the plumes. However, given the\nsize of the campus and it's 24-hour schedule, a much larger research\nteam would have been required to quantify all the burning. Finally, The\nhumidity, and the potential for interference was not accounted for; the\nmeasurements were not adjusted for humidity which could affect the\nvalues, though not enough to significantly alter the key findings and\nneed for immediate action.\n\n### Computational reproducibility and data availability\n\nR Statistical Software version 4.2.1, RStudio IDE version 2023.3.0.386,\nand Quarto scientific publishing system version were used for\nquantitative data analysis and writing of the manuscript [@R-base;\n@allaire2022quartoa; @positteam2023rstudio]. A set of additional R\npackages were used for data wrangling, analysis, and visualisation\n[@ggplot22016; @lubridate2011; @R-dplyr; @R-forcats; @R-ggplot2;\n@R-janitor; @R-leaflet; @R-lubridate; @R-mapview; @R-readr; @R-tidyr;\n@R-waffle].\n\nRaw data and analysis-ready processed data is available as an R package\nat @R-qechairquality. The data underlying the tables and figures of this\nmanuscript are contained in a repository alongside a reproducible\ndocument that contains the analysis code and the written narrative of\nthe manuscript \\[TODO: manuscript software citation\\].\n\n# Theory/calculation (not applicable)\n\n# Results and Discussion\n\nThe Malawi Bureau of Standards is the national agency responsible for\nsetting and publishing all standards in the country. At the time of\nwriting, the official website (www.mbsmw.org) was not available.\nHowever, published work that references Malawian standards\n[@kutlarjoss2017time; @mapoma2014air] indicate that the maximum 24-h\nPM~10~ value is 25 µg/m^3^ and the maximum annual PM~2.5~ value is 8\nµg/m^3^. There is no daily maximum value for PM~2.5~. It should be noted\nthat both of these values are at, or below, the level-4 interim WHO\ntargets.\n\nTherefore, for international comparisons and due to the lack of\ncomprehensive Malawian Standards, we use the WHO recommendations as a\nbasis of comparison for the measured values\n[@worldhealthorganization2021who]. The relevant particulate matter\ntargets are presented in @tbl-who-targets.\n\n(TODO: REPLACE screenshot with actual data)\n\n\n::: {#tbl-who-targets .cell tbl-cap='Particulate matter targets from [@worldhealthorganization2021who]'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](img/image-replace-table.png){width=306}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Particulate Measurements\n\n### Peaks\n\nDue to localised variation (air movement in the immediate area) and the\ndensity of the observations, the plotted 5-minute data obscure\npersistent trends. The full set of 5-minute data are plotted and\npresented in Appendix A @fig-five-minute-intervals. However, the number\nof measured values that exceeded the hazardous limit for both parameters\nare summarised in @tbl-peaks.\n\n\n::: {.cell tbl-cap='Peaks for both PM~2.5~ and PM~10~ are the number of data points above the WHO interim target 1 (annual) which is the least stringent; the number of observations recorded (count) is provided for reference.'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n|location          |     n| pm10| pm2.5|\n|:-----------------|-----:|----:|-----:|\n|Administration    | 10900|  171|     0|\n|Guardian Shelter  | 11032| 4529|     0|\n|Lighthouse Clinic | 11472| 4365|     0|\n|Lions Sight       | 11749|   91|     0|\n|Malaria           | 12031|  617|     0|\n|Mercy James       | 12193|  736|     0|\n|Ward 6B           | 11861| 1113|     0|\n|uMoyo             | 10637|  703|     0|\n:::\n:::\n\n\nOver the course of the two-month study, the hazardous limits for both\nparameters were exceeded at all locations except for the Lions Sight\nhospital. The limits were exceeded fewer than 50 times at five of the\nlocations, and only the monitors at the Lighthouse Clinic and the\nGuardian Shelter recorded more than 50 instances above the hazardous\nlimits. At the Lighthouse Clinic, the PM~10~ limit was exceeded almost\ntwice as often as the PM~2.5~ limit, while at the Guardian Shelter, the\nreverse is true. Because the Lighthouse Clinic is within 50 m of the\nincinerator, the number and predominance of PM~10~ peaks is\ncharacteristic of incomplete combustion and dust that is typical for the\narea and the open burning that occurs there. The residents at the\nGuardian Shelter however are mostly cooking within contained clay stoves\nthat have been designed to improve combustion of the coal and wood that\nis burned within them. The fewer number of PM~10~ peaks is a testament\nto this intervention, though the frequency of PM~2.5~ peaks is still\nbeyond acceptable.\n\n### 24-hour averages\n\nThe 24-hour averaged values (logged every 5 minutes) are presented for\neach location, for both PM~10~ and PM~2.5~ in fig-24-hour-average. As\nwell as dampening local variation and peaks, the WHO air quality\nguidelines are also based on 24-hour averages which are the standard\nagainst which the health risks can be judged.\n\nOverall, PM~2.5~ values remained below 100 µg/m^3^ at 6 of 8 locations\n(Administration, Lions Sight, Malaria Project, uMoyo, Ward 6B, and Mercy\nJames); PM~10~ values were consistently below 100µg/m^3^ at the same\nlocations, but with several average values extending slightly above, and\nthen infrequently.\n\nThe daily averages at both the Lighthouse Clinic and the Guardian\nShelter are both consistently higher for both parameters and the two\naverages closely followed the same general trends. Though the peaks at\nthe Lighthouse Clinic were higher than the Guardian Shelter, the low\nvalues were consistently lower, indicating more times of little or no\nburning, unlike the Guardian Shelter emissions which were relatively\nconstant. However, further analysis of 12 hour averages (8:00-15:59\n(working hours) and 16:00-7:59 (evening)) did not indicate clear\ndifferences between the time periods; stated differently, the data did\nnot clearly point to more or less burning in the day or at night.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Average 24-hour PM~10~ and PM~2.5~ at 8 monitoring stations over 2 months](manuscript_files/figure-html/fig03-24-hour-average-1.png){fig-align='center' width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### PM ratios\n\nGiven that the type of fuel and the type of burning (contained vs. open)\nproduce very different particulate \"fingerprints\", the ratio of PM~10~\nto PM~2.5~ values were examined to determine if a clear difference\nbetween locations, and therefore source, could be identified. The\nresults are presented in @fig-pm-ratios.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![PM~10~:PM~2.5~ values for each location.

Does not include 14th to 16th October at location uMoyo due to extreme outliers.](manuscript_files/figure-html/fig04-pm-ratios-1.png){fig-align='center' width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe results presented in Figure 5 illustrate both the presence of PM~10~\nrelative to PM~2.5~ as well as the range of values over which that ratio\nis observed.\n\nUnlike the peak values presented in Table 2, the values presented in\nFigure 5 indicate the relative presence of larger (PM~10~) particles to\nsmaller ones (PM~2.5~) regardless of their concentration: the ratio of\ntwo low concentrations can be the same as the ratio of two high\nconcentrations and is therefore more indicative of source than of\nproximity.\n\nIn general, the calculated ratios are concentrated between 1.25 with few\nvalues exceeding 7.5. Three from each the Guardian Shelter and the Ward\n6B exceeded 7.5 though the most values exceeding 5 were at the Guardian\nShelter. It is interesting to note that despite the large daily\nvariations at the Lighthouse Clinic, the parameter ratios there were\nfairly consistent with few spikes, and only 2 days with ratios above 5.\n\nAn examination of the range of ratios is used to better understand the\nvariability within a single day. For example, several of the calculated\nvalues at the Guardian Shelter have a range of more than 5, and one day\nhad a range of close to 10 i.e. the minimum ratio recorded for that day\nwas close to 1 and the maximum value was over 10. The composition of\nemissions recorded at that location ranged significantly, and likely\nreflects a range of burning styles and/or fuel type.\n\n## Exposure Data\n\nThe relative amount of time exposed to a given category of air quality\nis shown in @fig-percent-exposure. Each square represents 1% of the\nmeasured time.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Percentage of measured values categorised according to WHO 2021 targets](manuscript_files/figure-html/fig05-percent-exposure-1.png){fig-align='center' width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nUnsurprisingly, a majority of the air quality at the Lighthouse Clinic\nand the Guardian Shelter falls at, or below, interim target 1. What is\nless expected is that even though there are fewer days of hazardous or\nvery bad air quality at the other locations, most locations do not have\ntarget 4 values for even half of the time. Mercy James, the Malaria\nProject and Lions Sight have the largest percentages of days with air\nquality meeting the interim target 4. Interim target 2 rated air\noccupies an unexpectedly large proportion of the days at all locations,\nindicating that although there are a few very toxic, and a few quite\ngood days, the majority of the air is actually neither, but still cause\nfor concern.\n\n## \"The Air We Breathe is Not Good\": Perspectives from QECH\n\nAs the previous section has described, the open incineration of waste at\nQECH has created hazardous conditions for those occupying the space.\nThese risks were not lost on staff and caregivers, as interviews\ndemonstrated broad and near universal awareness of the poor air quality\nwithin the hospital grounds. Overwhelmingly, within interviews, both\ncaregivers and staff were quick to decry the poor quality of the air,\ngenerally without prompting. The few exceptions were those staff posted\non the peripheries of the hospital grounds, at a distance from the\nspaces of incineration. However, even those who did not experience the\nimpacts of the burning, were aware of it, and considered themselves\nfortunate to be posted in a section of the hospital where it was less of\na problem. Furthermore, according to caregivers and staff who work night\nshifts, air quality can be particularly bad at night and in the early\nmorning, despite the smoke being less visible, due to the habit of\njanitorial staff concentrating their burning during the late hours. The\npoor air quality on hospital grounds is also a frequent cause for\ncomplaint by patients and visitors, with nearly every staff member\ninterviewed being able to recall having received a complaint, and in\nturn, complaining to administration. One of the staff[^7] members\nresponsible for the burning said that he personally, had received\nhundreds of complaints, but was powerless to affect meaningful change,\naside from burning at different hours, until the incinerator could be\nrepaired.\n\n[^7]: ID3, 2019-11-18\n\nNonetheless, despite this consensus that air quality caused by the\nburning of waste within the hospital was a problem, significant\ndifferences emerged between respondents over their understandings of\npotential impacts, the effectiveness of various coping mechanisms, and\ntheir problematisations linked to the burning of specific waste\nmaterials. In addition, interviews revealed that these understandings\nwere informed by a significant amount of misinformation, even amongst\ntrained medical staff, which may contribute to them being less able to\nmitigate potential risks for themselves and those who rely on their\ncare.\n\n### Impacts, Problematisations, and Misinformation\n\nThe poor air quality within QECH was responsible, according to\nrespondents, for a wide array of health impacts. The most common ones\ncited included: coughing and sneezing, sore throat, stinging eyes,\nbreathing difficulties, and persistent cold and flu. Nausea was also\nmentioned, but was not a commonly described impact. Only one\nrespondent[^8], of the 26 total interviewed, did not describe lingering\nhealth impacts which they could ascribe to the smoke, however, they also\ndescribed having chronic eye irritation, but did not believe the smoke\nwas a contributing factor.\n\n[^8]: ID1, 2019-11-18\n\nIn addition to these impacts, which respondents bear on a daily basis,\nmany also believed that the smoke could contribute to a number of more\nserious, long-term health complications. For instance, nearly a quarter\nof respondents raised concerns of the potential impact that the smoke\ncould have on patients or staff with asthma. Others flagged poor air\nquality as a potential risk factor for certain cancers, lung disease, or\nheart problems. For a few, the smoke posed an unknown danger, they were\nnot sure what types of impacts it could have, but they were sure it was\nharmful in some way.\n\nAlso, understandably, given the large tuberculosis ward present within\nthe hospital grounds, and the high prevalence of the disease within\nMalawi [@worldhealthorganization2019global] there was significant\nconcern (more than half of respondents) about the impact the poor air\nquality could have on the infected. However, there also persisted a\nbelief among several respondents, including several nurses, that the\nsmoke could be a cause of the disease itself. As one staff member[^9]\nstated, \"I believe breathing this air for a long time can cause\nTuberculosis.\" This, however, was only one of the few instances of\nmisinformation which staff members held regarding air quality and\nhealth. Another example, voiced by several respondents, included a\nbelief that some staff members were immune to ill-health impacts of the\nsmoke, because they had received vaccinations from the hospital.\nNonetheless, they were concerned about the impacts of the smoke on\npatients and visitors, as one staff member[^10] expressed:\n\n[^9]: ID8, 2019-11-20\n\n[^10]: ID3, 2019-11-18\n\n> Personally, I have never experienced \\[eye discomfort\\] because I get\n> vaccinated and I am protected including other staff. However, we\n> realise that the air can badly affect other people and patients who\n> come to this place.\n\nAnother interesting misconception that emerged, which may be tied partly\nto translation and transcription, was a different cultural understanding\nof smoke versus smells. More than half of the respondents appeared to\nconflate the two, with some expressing a belief that it was the odour of\nwhat was being burnt that was harmful, rather than the smoke being given\noff. This has led many to specifically problematise the burning of\ncertain wastes, such as plastics, medicines, and other medical wastes,\nwhich give off distinctive or less pleasant odours, as opposed to the\nburning of other items, such as garden refuse, which may produce\nsignificant smoke, and contribute to higher recorded values of\nparticulate matter, but produce a less pungent, or more normalised,\nodour.\n\n### Coping Mechanisms\n\nFinally, in order to manage the impacts of QECH's persistently poor air\nquality, staff and visitors reported having developed a number of coping\nmechanisms, designed to help them get through their daily routines.\nThese included staying indoors, blocking doors and windows, and taking\nbreaks away from hospital grounds in order to catch some breaths of\nfresher air. However, for janitorial staff[^11], inside was not\nnecessarily better, as several reported their indoor workspaces as being\nalso insufferable for long periods of time from the smell of cleaning\nagents and other chemicals. Furthermore, amongst respondents there was a\ngeneral disagreement over the effectiveness of personal protective\nequipment (PPE), such as face masks, towards mitigating the impacts of\nthe smoke. A few staff described pleading to hospital administration for\nsuch equipment, to no avail. However, other staff members, who do have\naccess to PPE, noted that even face masks do little to mitigate the\nimpacts of the smoke, describing them as ineffective.\n\n[^11]: ID14, 2019-11-23\n\nMost staff, however, have been unable to find any way to mitigate the\nimpacts of the smoke, and only found relief once they reached home at\nthe end of their shift, as one of the janitorial staff described, \"we\nonly feel safe when we are home\". Of course, this relief is not\navailable for the hundreds of patients and caregivers who sleep at QECH\nor are unable to leave. Ultimately, most place their hope in the\nconstruction of the new incinerator (which had not yet been activated at\nthe time of the interviews), and biding their time as construction drags\non; coping as best they can. As the same member of the janitorial\nstaff[^11] described, \"we are just hoping we will start breathing good\nair soon, when the new incinerator is opened.\"\n\n[^11]: ID14, 2019-11-23\n\n# Conclusions\n\nThe air quality, as a result of open waste burning at Queen's is poor\nand not suitable for a city, let alone a hospital. Over the course of\nthis two-month study, the hazardous limits for both PM parameters were\nexceeded at all locations except for the Lions Sight hospital. The WHO\nlimits were exceeded fewer than 50 times at five of the locations, and\nonly the monitors at the Lighthouse Clinic and the Guardian Shelter\nrecorded more than 50 instances above the most hazardous limit. The\ncomposition of emissions recorded ranged significantly, analysed as the\nratio PM~10~:PM~2.5~ likely reflects a range of burning styles and/or\nfuel (waste) type, and no discernible trend was observed.. Among\ninterview respondents, there was a general consensus that air quality\ncaused by the burning of waste within the hospital was a problem,\nalthough there were significant differences between respondents over\ntheir understandings of potential impacts, the effectiveness of various\ncoping mechanisms, and their problematisations linked to the burning of\nspecific waste materials. For most, going home or leaving the Queen's\ncampus was the only pathway to relief, though for patients who can not\nleave, endurance was the only option. This work was originally planned\nas a before-and-after study: we envisioned reporting these baseline\nresults compared to follow-up measurements once the long-promised\nincinerator was commissioned. However, nearly 4 years later, the\nincinerator is rarely functional (partly for technical reasons, partly\nfor financial ones) and the smoke hovering over Queen's is still thick.\nWaste management has long been known as an environmental health issue,\nbut in the case of open trash burning at a medical facility, it becomes\nmore: for some of the most vulnerable, especially those with TB, asthma\nor other chronic disease, it could be a matter of life or death.\n\n# Acknowledgements\n\nThe authors are grateful to the staff, patients and caregivers at QECH\nfor their assistance, willingness to share their views, and importantly,\nperseverance in delivering the best care possible under difficult\ncircumstances. Moreover, we would like to acknowledge the assistance and\neffort of Open Data Durban, now the Open Cities Lab, for their\nassistance in constructing and programming the sensors.\n\n# Appendix {.unnumbered}\n\nIf there is more than one appendix, they should be identified as A, B,\netc. Formulae and equations in appendices should be given separate\nnumbering: Eq.

The Raspberry Pi operating system runs off of Rasbian software on a\n    NOOBS scandisk.\n2.  Air quality monitoring code is written in Python using the [aqi\n    library](https://pypi.org/project/python-aqi/) (A library of\n    algorithms to convert between AQI value and pollutant\n    concentration). The code is stored on the [Open Data Durban GitHub\n    account](https://github.com/opendatadurban/hospital_stations) and is\n    free for all to access. To be able to collect data, the device needs\n    to be connected to a reliable wifi network, the SSID and password\n    need to be coded onto the device during step 2 in the building\n    method.\n3.  Once the whole device has been put together and placed on site, to\n    access that data we use a combination of programs:\n\n-   [Putty](https://www.putty.org/) - this is an SSH client that we use\n    to gain access to the Raspberry Pi from another computer. To be able\n    to access the Raspberry Pi in question, the computer in use and the\n    air quality monitoring device need to be on the same network for the\n    connection to be successful.\n-   [Winscp](https://winscp.net/eng/download.php) - this is an FTP\n    client that we use, in conjunction with Putty, to be able to\n    transfer data files from the air quality monitoring device to one's\n    computer.\n-   [Remote.it](https://app.remote.it/) - this is an application that\n    supports remote SSH, so this is used when wanting to access data\n    from a device that is not connected to the same network as the\n    computer in use. Remote.it is used together with Putty and Winscp to\n    access the air quality data remotely.\n\n### Connection/building method {.unnumbered}\n\nTo build the sensor, we followed these steps:\n\n1.  Set up the Raspberry Pi with the Rasbian software using the NOOBS\n    scandisk. (insert the scandisk into the Raspberry Pi) A\n    comprehensive start up guide can be found here.\n2.  Next we load the code onto the Raspberry Pi. The code can be found\n    on the Open Data Durban Hospital Stations Repository Github. To use\n    it you can follow the steps in the file called Initiate_WS.txt. Once\n    all the steps have been completed, the Raspberry Pi is now a device\n    that can be connected to a particulate matter monitoring sensor.\\\n3.  Connect the hardware components\n\n-   Connect the Raspberry Pi to the Nova PM Sensor using the break out\n    board that comes with the Sensor.\n-   Connect the battery to the Raspberry Pi via the micro port\n-   Attach the rubber pipe to the sensor\n-   Assemble all components inside the box, with the pipe coming out of\n    the drilled hole\n-   To prevent dirt entering the system, close off all openings between\n    the pipe and the box with silicone putty\n-   Secure box in an elevated position (not too close to the ground) and\n    with the pipe facing the direction of the inflow of the air under\n    investigation.\n\n# References {.unnumbered}\n",
