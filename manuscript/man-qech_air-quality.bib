	abstract = {Recently, many researchers paid more attentions to the association between air pollution and respiratory system disease. In the past few years, levels of smog have increased throughout China resulting in the deterioration of air quality, raising worldwide concerns. PM2.5 (particles less than 2.5 micrometers in diameter) can penetrate deeply into the lung, irritate and corrode the alveolar wall, and consequently impair lung function. Hence it is important to investigate the impact of PM2.5 on the respiratory system and then to help China combat the current air pollution problems. In this review, we will discuss PM2.5 damage on human respiratory system from epidemiological, experimental and mechanism studies. At last, we recommend to the population to limit exposure to air pollution and call to the authorities to create an index of pollution related to health.},

These emissions, however, are not included in many current emission inventories used for chemistry and climate modeling applications. This paper presents the ﬁrst comprehensive and consistent estimates of the global emissions of greenhouse gases, particulate matter, reactive trace gases, and toxic compounds from open waste burning. Global emissions of CO2 from open waste burning are relatively small compared to total anthropogenic CO2; however, regional CO2 emissions, particularly in many developing countries in Asia and Africa, are substantial. Further, emissions of reactive trace gases and particulate matter from open waste burning are more signiﬁcant on regional scales. For example, the emissions of PM10 from open domestic waste burning in China is equivalent to 22\% of China’s total reported anthropogenic PM10 emissions. The results of the emissions model presented here suggest that emissions of many air pollutants are signiﬁcantly underestimated in current inventories because open waste burning is not included, consistent with studies that compare model results with available observations.},

The rapid pace of increase in population, economic growth, urbanization and industrialization is coupled with accelerated solid waste generation. In most of the developing countries wastes are either scattered in urban centers or disposed off unplanned in low lying areas or open dumps. The lack of infrastructure for collection, transportation, treatment and disposal of solid waste, proper solid waste management planning, insufﬁcient ﬁnancial resources, technical expertise and public attitude have made the situation exasperating due to which several environmental and health related problems are increasing. Though, there are many negative issues related to solid waste, it also provides many opportunities that not only mitigates its negative impact but also helps in meeting the demand for energy and employment generation as well as in soil health improvement. Keeping in mind the present situation the current review was planned with the objective to overlook the challenges and opportunities faced during urban solid waste management in developing countries like India.},

The results present that the major indicators had obvious regional differences, which can divide Africa into three levels: North Africa and South Africa {\textgreater} West Africa and Central Africa {\textgreater} East Africa. Besides, the disposal methods in North Africa, South Africa and West Africa have evolved from simple open dumping to sanitary landfill, composting and recycle treatment, while opening dumping is still rampant in East Africa. With a combination tool of Principal Component Analysis and Multiple Linear Regression, it was identified that eco­ nomic growth, urbanization and geographical location are the most critical factors influencing the unbalanced statue of MSW management in Africa.

	abstract = {Solid waste management remains a challenge globally attributed to several factors including inadequacies and ineffectiveness of policies. Presumably, good policies should translate to better solid waste management prac­ tices. However, other underlying factors and implementation challenges may determine the waste management status. Thus the debate in the literature on solid waste management policy and practice remains inconclusive. Based on literature review, this paper examines the discourse on solid waste management regulation and status in Sub-Saharan Africa. A paradox of policy outcomes is revealed at global and national level. Global policies have not been holistically contextualised and integrated in national policies. While national policies have not improved the solid waste management status of some countries, in others, it has, albeit unsustainably. Notably, inherent weaknesses such as insufficiency, homogeneity and ambiguity of policies affects implementation. This is exacerbated by poor enforcement strategies, lack of participatory mechanisms, inadequate sensitisation, influ­ ence of power and politics, as well as weak political commitment, among others. To ensure smart and clean cities, it is crucial for initiatives of solid waste management not only to be legally supported, but also contextualised and co-generated. For effective policy implementation, there is need for sensitisation of urban dwellers to enable comprehension of policies. Participatory strategies and governments’ commitment towards solid waste man­ agement should be paramount. Due to rapid changes in urban areas, periodic studies on content and context inferences such as solid waste collection practices and participation of actors in the informal settlements are required to dispel the practice of homogenising policies in order to enhance relevancy and suitability.},

@article{mohapatra2014effect,
	title = {Effect of {Particulate} {Matter} ({PM}) on plants, climate, ecosystems, and human health},
	abstract = {Particulate matter (PM) is a complex mixture of solid and liquid particles that are suspended in air. These particles typically consist of a mixture of inorganic and organic chemicals, including carbon, sulfates, nitrates, metals, acids, and semi-volatile compounds. The size of PM in air ranges from approximately 0.005 to 100 micrometers (µm) in diameter -- the size of just a few atoms to about the thickness of a human hair. Researchers have defined size categories for these particles differently. PM is defined by three general categories commonly used by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA): coarse (10 to 2.5 µm), fine (2.5 µm or smaller), and ultrafine (0.1 µm or smaller). Research suggests that particle size is an important factor that influences how particles deposit in the respiratory tract and affect human health. Coarse particles are deposited almost exclusively in the nose and throat; whereas, fine and ultrafine particles generally are able to penetrate to deep areas of the lung. Fine and ultrafine particles are present in greater numbers and have greater surface area than larger particles of the same mass, and they are generally considered to be more toxic. Most countries contribute to aiborne particulate matter pollution in other countries. In the past couple of years particulate matter has recieved media attention, concequential to the discovery of thousand of people dying young of particulate matter introduced health effects. This includes both short-term and long-term effects. Particulate matter does not only cause health effects, it also plays a role in the green house effect and global warming because of its contribution to cloud formation. Particulate matter is released from natural sources, such as volcanic eruptions, sea salt, or soils. Anthropogenic sources, such as car exhausts, industry, shipping and coal and ore fabrication, cause increases in airborne particulate matter concentrations on many locations. Deposition of these particulate matters on vegetated surfaces depend on the size distribution of these particles and effects of particulate matter on vegetation may be associated with the reduction in light required for photosynthesis and increase in leaf temperature due to changed surface optical properties.},

	abstract = {Ambient air pollution has been associated with adverse respiratory outcomes, especially among children with asthma. This study reports on associations between daily ambient air pollutant concentrations and the respiratory symptoms of schoolchildren living in Durban, South Africa. This city is Africa's busiest port and a key hub for imported crude oil and exported reﬁned petroleum and petrochemical products, and it experiences a mixture of air pollutants that reﬂects emissions from industry, trafﬁc and biomass burning. Children in four communities in the highly industrialized southern portion of the city were compared to children of similar socio-economic proﬁles living in the north of the city. One school was selected in each community. A total of 423 children were recruited. Symptom logs were completed every 1.5e2 h over 3-week period in each of four seasons. Ambient concentrations of NO2, NO, SO2, CO, O3, PM2.5 and PM10 were measured throughout the study. Generalized estimating equation (GEE) models were used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and assess lag effects (1e5 days) using single pollutant (single lags or distributed lags) models. Concentrations of SO2 and NOx were markedly higher in the south, while PM10 did not vary. Signiﬁcant increase in the odds ratios of cough were identiﬁed for the various lags analyzed. The OR of symptoms was further increased among those living in the south compared to the north. In conclusion, in this analysis of over 70,000 observations, we provide further evidence that exposure to PM10, SO2, NO2 and NO is associated with signiﬁcantly increased occurrence of respiratory symptoms among children. This was evident for cough, shortness of breath, and chest tightness, across the four pollutants and for different lags of exposure. This is the ﬁrst study describing these changes in sub-Saharan Africa.},

An analysis of literature on the work done and reported mainly in publications from 2005 to 2011, related to waste management in developing countries, showed that few articles give quantitative information. The analysis was conducted in two of the major scientiﬁc journals, Waste Management Journal and Waste Management and Research. The objective of this research was to determine the stakeholders’ action/behavior that have a role in the waste management process and to analyze inﬂuential factors on the system, in more than thirty urban areas in 22 developing countries in 4 continents. A combination of methods was used in this study in order to assess the stakeholders and the factors inﬂuencing the performance of waste management in the cities. Data was collected from scientiﬁc literature, existing data bases, observations made during visits to urban areas, structured interviews with relevant professionals, exercises provided to participants in workshops and a questionnaire applied to stakeholders. Descriptive and inferential statistic methods were used to draw conclusions. The outcomes of the research are a comprehensive list of stakeholders that are relevant in the waste management systems and a set of factors that reveal the most important causes for the systems’ failure. The information provided is very useful when planning, changing or implementing waste management systems in cities.},

This article assessed the current status of solid waste management in LDCs from waste generation to disposal. Solid waste generation in LDCs averages 0.56 kg/capita/day while the solid waste stream consists mainly of organics (52\%) followed by recyclables (26\%). Waste collection is also low and due to irregular waste collection, many people in LDCs resort to illegal practices such as illegal dumping or open burning of wastes. Sanitary landfilling is almost non-existent in LDCs with some of the few landfills present severely lacking in effective leachate or gas collection systems. While recycling is carried out in some LDCs, the most common practice is to collect recyclables for exportation. Similarly, composting of solid waste exists mainly on small-scale while biogas plants present in LDCs are used mostly for treatment of animal manure. Some of the challenges faced by LDCs include lack of funding, infrastructure, legislations, knowledge, and awareness on solid waste issues. However, there is a huge potential for job creation in the solid waste management field including waste collection, recycling, composting and even sanitary landfilling.},

Accordingly, the study revealed that the peak hour for high pollutant concentration emission ranges between 8 pm to 11 pm hours, and the mean air quality index was more than a moderate level. Particularly, on Hidar Sitaten in 2019 at 9 pm the maximum concentration of PM2.5 was 8.6 times higher than WHO air quality guideline standard of daily allowance. The highest mean of air quality index and concentration of PM2.5 recorded was 112 and 44.2 µg/m3 on 21 November 2017, respectively, and it was found to be unhealthy for sensitive groups. This implies that the concentration of PM2.5 was harmful to people who are unusually sensitive to particulate pollution and have health problems. Therefore, public participation and strong regulations are needed on air quality management to strike a balance between a cultural practice of Hidar Sitaten and healthy air quality.},

Industrial expansion in these cities is also a major contributor to the worsening air pollution. Exposure to ambient air pollution is a major threat to human health in SSA with 176,000 deaths and 626,000 DALYs in the region attributable to ambient air pollution exposure. These estimates are however likely to be much higher than reported due to the limited data emanating from the region. Recently, the adoption of the World Health Assembly resolution on air pollution and health, and Sustainable Development Goals are a welcome boost for urban air pollution control efforts in SSA. In this article, we have outlined within the broad framework of these international policy instruments, measures for addressing urban air pollution and its associated health impacts in SSA sustainably.},

	abstract = {Poor air quality is a development challenge. Urbanization and industrial development along with increased populations have brought clear socio-economic beneﬁts to Low-and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs) but can also bring disadvantages such as decreasing air quality. A lack of reliable air quality data in East African cities makes it difﬁcult to understand air pollution exposure and to predict future air quality trends. This work documents urban air quality and air pollution exposure in the capital cities of Kampala (Uganda), Addis Ababa (Ethiopia) and Nairobi (Kenya). We build a situational awareness of air pollution through repeated static and dynamic mobile monitoring in a range of urban locations, including urban background, roadside (pavement and building), rural background, and bus station sites, alongside vehicle-based measurements including buses and motorcycle taxis. Data suggest that the measured particulate matter mass concentrations (PM2.5, PM10) in all studied cities was at high concentrations, and often hazardous to human health, as deﬁned by WHO air quality guidelines. Overall, the poorest air quality was observed in Kampala, where mean daily PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations were signiﬁcantly above the WHO limits at urban background locations by 122\% and 69\% and at roadside locations by 193\% and 215\%, respectively. Trafﬁc is clearly a major contributor to East African urban air pollution; monitoring in Kampala and Addis Ababa, on motorcycle taxis, in buses and at bus stations indicated that drivers and commuters were exposed to poor air quality throughout their commute. Road-related air pollution can also impact indoor locations near roads. Using one exemplar building located within Nairobi’s Central Business District, it is shown that measured outdoor PM concentrations signiﬁcantly correlate with the indoor air quality (r=0.84). This link between roadside emissions and indoor air pollution within buildings located close to the road should be explored more fully. This study, through a series of case studies, provides clear evidence that roads and trafﬁc need to be a focus for mitigation strategies to reduce air pollution exposure in East African cities.},

	abstract = {Introduction
              Air and noise pollution are emerging environmental health hazards in African cities, with potentially complex spatial and temporal patterns. Limited local data are a barrier to the formulation and evaluation of policies to reduce air and noise pollution.
            
            
              Methods and analysis
              
                We designed a year-long measurement campaign to characterise air and noise pollution and their sources at high-resolution within the Greater Accra Metropolitan Area (GAMA), Ghana. Our design uses a combination of fixed (year-long, n=10) and rotating (week-long, n ={\textasciitilde}130) sites, selected to represent a range of land uses and source influences (eg, background, road traffic, commercial, industrial and residential areas, and various neighbourhood socioeconomic classes). We will collect data on fine particulate matter (PM
                2.5
                ), nitrogen oxides (NO
                x
                ), weather variables, sound (noise level and audio) along with street-level time-lapse images. We deploy low-cost, low-power, lightweight monitoring devices that are robust, socially unobtrusive, and able to function in Sub-Saharan African (SSA) climate. We will use state-of-the-art methods, including spatial statistics, deep/machine learning, and processed-based emissions modelling, to capture highly resolved temporal and spatial variations in pollution levels across the GAMA and to identify their potential sources. This protocol can serve as a prototype for other SSA cities.
              
            
            
              Ethics and dissemination
              This environmental study was deemed exempt from full ethics review at Imperial College London and the University of Massachusetts Amherst; it was approved by the University of Ghana Ethics Committee (ECH 149/18-19). This protocol is designed to be implementable in SSA cities to map environmental pollution to inform urban planning decisions to reduce health harming exposures to air and noise pollution. It will be disseminated through local stakeholder engagement (public and private sectors), peer-reviewed publications, contribution to policy documents, media, and conference presentations.},

	abstract = {Ambient air pollution in urban cities in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is an important public health problem with models and limited monitoring data indicating high concentrations of pollutants such as ﬁne particulate matter (PM2.5). On most global air quality index maps, however, information about ambient pollution from SSA is scarce. We evaluated the feasibility and practicality of longitudinal measurements of ambient PM2.5 using low-cost air quality sensors (Purple Air-II-SD) across thirteen locations in seven countries in SSA. Devices were used to gather data over a 30-day period with the aim of assessing the eﬃciency of its data recovery rate and identifying challenges experienced by users in each location. The median data recovery rate was 94\% (range: 72\% to 100\%). The mean 24 h concentration measured across all sites was 38 µg/m3 with the highest PM2.5 period average concentration of 91 µg/m3 measured in Kampala, Uganda and lowest concentrations of 15 µg/m3 measured in Faraja, The Gambia. Kampala in Uganda and Nnewi in Nigeria recorded the longest periods with concentrations {\textgreater}250 µg/m3. Power outages, SD memory card issues, internet connectivity problems and device safety concerns were important challenges experienced when using Purple Air-II-SD sensors. Despite some operational challenges, this study demonstrated that it is reasonably practicable and feasible to establish a network of low-cost devices to provide data on local PM2.5 concentrations in SSA countries. Such data are crucially needed to raise public, societal and policymaker awareness about air pollution across SSA.},

	abstract = {Objective—To examine associations between ambient air pollutants and respiratory outcomes among schoolchildren in Durban, South Africa.
Methods—Primary schools from within each of seven communities in two regions of Durban (the highly industrialised south compared with the non-industrial north) were selected. Children from randomly selected grade 4 classrooms were invited to participate. Standardised interviews, spirometry, methacholine challenge testing and skin-prick testing were conducted. Particulate matter (PM), sulphur dioxide (SO2) and carbon monoxide were monitored at each school, while nitrogen oxides (NOx) and other pollutants were monitored at other sites.
Results—SO2 was significantly higher in the south than in the north, while PM concentrations were similar across the city. The prevalence of symptoms consistent with asthma of any severity was 32.1\%. Covariate-adjusted prevalences were higher among children from schools in the south than among those from the north for persistent asthma (12.2\% v. 9.6 \%) and for marked airway hyperreactivity (AHR) (8.1\% v. 2.8\%), while SO2 resulted in a twofold increased risk of marked AHR (95\% confidence interval 0.98 – 4.66; p=0.056).
Conclusions—Schoolchildren from industrially exposed communities experienced higher covariate-adjusted prevalences of persistent asthma and marked AHR than children from communities distant from industrial sources. Our findings are strongly suggestive of industrial pollution-related adverse respiratory health effects among these children.},

The study assess levels and variations of carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) in Blantyre, Malawi using a stationary environmental monitoring station (EMS). Results show that CO level (2.47 ± 1.23 mg m-3) were below the Malawian limit value (10.31 mg m-3). Although, NO2 (4.02 ± 2.47 mg m-3) and SO2 (8.58 ± 2.88 mg m-3) were significantly higher than allowable Malawian Standards (0.52 and 0.23 mg m-3, respectively). Discernible variations in hourly, diurnal, monthly and seasonal CO, SO2 and NO2 were apparent. Independent t-test confirmed that day time values were higher than those at night (p {\textless} 0.05). Thus, variations in local weather affect the disparity in hourly and diurnal values. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) confirmed significant variations in monthly observations. Moreover, independent t-test showed that wet season CO (2.32 mg m-3), SO2 (5.10 mg m-3) and NO2 (9.41 mg m-3) levels were higher than dry season values (CO = 2.32 mg m-3; SO2 = 3.42 mg m-3; NO2 = 8.13 mg m-3). A hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) divided the 10 months into three groups based on distribution of CO, SO2 and NO2, air temperature, wind speed and wind direction. Furthermore, factor analysis (FA) showed that air temperature had significant contribution to variations in mean values of CO, SO2 and NO2 for the entire study period. The study shows a need for constant urban air quality monitoring in Blantyre and all urban areas in Malawi. It is recommended that the experimental site widen the scope of the study by utilizing the flexibility of the EMS. Key words: Air pollutants, principal component analysis, developing countries, environmental monitoringstation, Kaiser normalization.},

	abstract = {While numerous studies have demonstrated that shortterm exposure to particulate matter (PM*) is associated with adverse health effects, the characteristics of PM that cause harm are not well understood, and PM toxicity may vary by its chemical composition. This study investigates whether spatial and temporal patterns in PM health effect estimates based on total mass can be explained by spatial and temporal heterogeneity in the chemical composition of the particles. A database of 52 chemical components of PM with an aerodynamic diameter \&lt; or = 2.5 pm (PM2.5) was constructed for 187 U.S. counties, for 2000 through 2005, based on data from U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) monitoring networks. Components that covary with PM2.5 total mass and/or are large contributors to PM2.5, total mass were identified using actual and seasonally detrended data. Using Bayesian hierarchical modeling, seasonal and temporal variation in PM2.5 and the risk of total, cardiovascular, and respiratory hospital admissions were investigated for persons \&gt; or = 65 years in 202 U.S. counties for 1999 through 2005. Seasonal variation was investigated using three model structures with different underlying assumptions about the relationship between PM2.5 and hospitalizations. The findings of this study indicate higher effects in winter for both causes of hospitalization, and higher effects in the Northeast for cardiovascular admissions, although 53\% of the counties were in this region. Higher PM2.5 effect estimates for cardiovascular or respiratory hospitalizations were observed in seasons and counties with a higher PM2.5 content of nickel (Ni), vanadium (V), or EC. Mortality effect estimates for PM with an aerodynamic diameter \&lt; or = 10 pm (PM10) were higher in seasons and counties with higher PM2.5 Ni content. The association between the Ni content of PM2.5 and effect estimates for cardiovascular hospitalization was robust to adjustment by EC, V, or both EC and V. An interquartile range (IQR) increase in the fraction of PM2.5 that is Ni was associated with a 14.9\% (PI, 3.4-26.4) increase in the relative rates of cardiovascular hospital admissions associated with PM2.5 total mass adjusted for EC and V. No associations were observed between PM total mass health effect estimates and community-level variables for socioeconomic status, racial composition, or urbanicity. Communities with a higher prevalence of central AC had lower PM2.5 effect estimates for cardiovascular hospital admissions. The findings of this study indicate strong spatial and temporal variation in the chemical composition of the particle mixture and in the regional and seasonal variation in health effect estimates for PM2.5 total mass. The chemical composition of particles partially explained the heterogeneity of effect estimates. Observed associations could be related to the components themselves, to other components, or to a combination of components that share similar sources. The findings do not exclude the possibility that other components or characteristics of PM are harmful. The limitations of this study include the use of community-level aggregated data for exposure and for the variables used to investigate alternate hypotheses. Also, particle components and chemical forms (e.g., ammonium sulfate) not measured in the U.S. EPA database were not included. PM10 results in particular should be viewed with caution as the time frame of measurement and PM size fraction are different for the chemical composition and health effects data. A better understanding of the particular chemical components or sources that are most harmful to health can help decision-makers develop more targeted air pollution regulations and can aid in understanding the biological mechanisms by which air pollution-related health effects occur, thereby informing future research.},

	abstract = {The World Health Organization estimates that particulate matter (PM) air pollution contributes to approximately 800,000 premature deaths each year, ranking it the 13th leading cause of mortality worldwide. However, many studies show that the relationship is deeper and far more complicated than originally thought. PM is a portion of air pollution that is made up of extremely small particles and liquid droplets containing acids, organic chemicals, metals, and soil or dust particles. PM is categorized by size and continues to be the fraction of air pollution that is most reliably associated with human disease. PM is thought to contribute to cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease by the mechanisms of systemic inflammation, direct and indirect coagulation activation, and direct translocation into systemic circulation. The data demonstrating PM's effect on the cardiovascular system are strong. Populations subjected to long-term exposure to PM have a significantly higher cardiovascular incident and mortality rate. Short-term acute exposures subtly increase the rate of cardiovascular events within days of a pollution spike. The data are not as strong for PM's effects on cerebrovascular disease, though some data and similar mechanisms suggest a lesser result with smaller amplitude. Respiratory diseases are also exacerbated by exposure to PM. PM causes respiratory morbidity and mortality by creating oxidative stress and inflammation that leads to pulmonary anatomic and physiologic remodeling. The literature shows PM causes worsening respiratory symptoms, more frequent medication use, decreased lung function, recurrent health care utilization, and increased mortality. PM exposure has been shown to have a small but significant adverse effect on cardiovascular, respiratory, and to a lesser extent, cerebrovascular disease. These consistent results are shown by multiple studies with varying populations, protocols, and regions. The data demonstrate a dose-dependent relationship between PM and human disease, and that removal from a PM-rich environment decreases the prevalence of these diseases. While further study is needed to elucidate the effects of composition, chemistry, and the PM effect on susceptible populations, the preponderance of data shows that PM exposure causes a small but significant increase in human morbidity and mortality. Most sources agree on certain “common sense” recommendations, although there are lonely limited data to support them. Indoor PM exposure can be reduced by the usage of air conditioning and particulate filters, decreasing indoor combustion for heating and cooking, and smoking cessation. Susceptible populations, such as the elderly or asthmatics, may benefit from limiting their outdoor activity during peak traffic periods or poor air quality days. These simple changes may benefit individual patients in both short-term symptomatic control and long-term cardiovascular and respiratory complications.},

	abstract = {Despite improvements in air quality in developed countries, air pollution remains a major public health issue. To fully assess the health impact, we must consider that air pollution exposure has both physical and psychological effects; this latter dimension, less documented, is more difficult to measure and subjective indicators constitute an appropriate alternative. In this context, this work presents the methodological development of a new scale to measure the perception of air quality, useful as an exposure or risk appraisal metric in public health contexts. On the basis of the responses from 2,522 subjects in eight French cities, psychometric methods are used to construct the scale from 22 items that assess risk perception (anxiety about health and quality of life) and the extent to which air pollution is a nuisance (sensorial perception and symptoms). The scale is robust, reproducible, and discriminates between subpopulations more susceptible to poor air pollution perception. The individual risk factors of poor air pollution perception are coherent with those findings in the risk perception literature. Perception of air pollution by the general public is a key issue in the development of comprehensive risk assessment studies as well as in air pollution risk management and policy. This study offers a useful new tool to measure such efforts and to help set priorities for air quality improvements in combination with air quality measurements.},

Urban air quality remains a major concern for both public health officials and the general public. In the United States, air quality public awareness campaigns are major efforts of governments at every level. Yet, our understanding of relationships between ambient air pollution exposure, public perceptions of air quality, and concerns about associated health risks is incomplete. We examined 2869 individual responses to annual air quality public awareness surveys administered between 2009 and 2012 in the Kansas City metropolitan area. Our study had three objectives: 1) examine the spatial distribution of PM2.5 and O3 exposures, pollution perceptions, and pollution health concerns; 2) explore relationships between individual- and area-level characteristics and PM2.5 and O3 exposure; 3) and examine cross-sectional associations between individual- and area-level characteristics, as well as PM2.5 and O3 exposures, and pollution perception and pollution health concerns. We found inverse spatial patterns between the distribution of O3 and PM2.5 exposure levels as well as between areas where respondents perceived air pollution as worsening and areas where residents had higher concern about the health effects of pollution exposure. We also found inverse relationships between individual- and area-level demographic and socioeconomic characteristics and O3 and PM2.5 exposure. Individual-level characteristics were significantly related to pollution perceptions, while both individual- and area-level characteristics were significantly related to pollution health concerns. Public awareness campaigns should be combined with education on ways the public can protect themselves and tailored explicitly for targeting vulnerable populations (e.g., elderly, and persons with respiratory problems) and areas both socioeconomically vulnerable (e.g., higher racial segregation and poverty) and experiencing higher pollution exposure (e.g., O3 and PM2.5).},

	abstract = {Air pollution has become a major environmental issue in African cities during the last decade. Rapid urbanization, traffic congestion combined with old cars and low quality fuel, open-burning of waste and biomass, dust and sandstorms are the major sources of air pollution. These anthropogenic and natural sources are responsible for emissions of particulate matter (PM), Nitrogen dioxide (NO2), Carbon monoxide (CO), sulphur dioxide (SO2), Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) that can affect human health. The comparative analysis of urban air pollution in Africa shows that very few cities measure air quality in Africa. In sub-Saharan Africa region, only South Africa and Senegal have setup continuous air quality monitoring system. Some other countries such as Nigeria and Ghana conducted air quality monitoring programs in 2011 and 2004 respectively. In the 2016 WHO urban air pollution database, 41 cities of 12 sub-Saharan African countries reported their data. The analysis shows that all these cities exceed the WHO guidelines for PM10 and PM2.5 annual concentrations. A case study for Dakar (Senegal) presents the distribution of the air quality measurement network around the city, the monitored pollutants and the Air Quality Index (AQI) that daily informs people and decision markers about the air quality. The AQI is unhealthy (orange) to very unhealthy (red) during the dry season (mid-November to April). During the rainy season (June to October), the AQI is good (green) to moderate (yellow). Air pollution in Dakar is mainly due to particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5). Annual mean of these PM exceeded WHO guidelines from 2010 to 2017. To tackle air pollution, regulations and measures are taken by Senegalese authorities to reduce emission from transport, industries and energy. For the transport sector, renewal of old cars and promoting of mass transport are the major projects. For other sources (industry, waste and energy), environmental law provides for preventive measures and energy efficiency programs are on-going.},

	abstract = {Rapid urban population growth, air pollution emissions, and changing patterns of disease in African cities may increase the burden of air pollution-related morbidity and mortality in coming decades. Yet, air monitoring is limited across the continent and many countries lack air quality standards. This paper focuses on particulate matter (PM) pollution, one of the most relevant and widely used indicators of urban air quality. We provide an overview of published PM monitoring studies in Africa, outline major themes, point out data gaps, and discuss strategies for addressing particulate air pollution in rapidly growing African cities. Our review reveals that, although few studies have reported annual mean levels of coarse and fine particles, collective evidence from short- and long-term air monitoring studies across urban Africa demonstrates that pollution levels often exceed international guidelines. Furthermore, pollution levels may be rising as a result of increased motor vehicle traffic building on already high background concentrations of PM in many locations due to climatic and geographic conditions. Biomass burning and industrial activities, often located in cities, further exacerbate levels of PM. Despite the health risks this situation presents, air quality programs, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, have been stalled or discontinued in recent years. Implementation of systematic PM data collection would enable air pollution-related health impact assessments, the development of strategies to reduce the air pollution health burden, and facilitate urban planning and transportation policy as it relates to air quality and health.},

	abstract = {Poor air quality is a development challenge. Urbanization and industrial development along with increased populations have brought clear socio-economic benefits to Low-and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs) but can also bring disadvantages such as decreasing air quality. A lack of reliable air quality data in East African cities makes it difficult to understand air pollution exposure and to predict future air quality trends. This work documents urban air quality and air pollution exposure in the capital cities of Kampala (Uganda), Addis Ababa (Ethiopia) and Nairobi (Kenya). We build a situational awareness of air pollution through repeated static and dynamic mobile monitoring in a range of urban locations, including urban background, roadside (pavement and building), rural background, and bus station sites, alongside vehicle-based measurements including buses and motorcycle taxis. Data suggest that the measured particulate matter mass concentrations (PM2.5, PM10) in all studied cities was at high concentrations, and often hazardous to human health, as defined by WHO air quality guidelines. Overall, the poorest air quality was observed in Kampala, where mean daily PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations were significantly above the WHO limits at urban background locations by 122\% and 69\% and at roadside locations by 193\% and 215\%, respectively. Traffic is clearly a major contributor to East African urban air pollution; monitoring in Kampala and Addis Ababa, on motorcycle taxis, in buses and at bus stations indicated that drivers and commuters were exposed to poor air quality throughout their commute. Road-related air pollution can also impact indoor locations near roads. Using one exemplar building located within Nairobi’s Central Business District, it is shown that measured outdoor PM concentrations significantly correlate with the indoor air quality (r = 0.84). This link between roadside emissions and indoor air pollution within buildings located close to the road should be explored more fully. This study, through a series of case studies, provides clear evidence that roads and traffic need to be a focus for mitigation strategies to reduce air pollution exposure in East African cities.},

	abstract = {Ambient air pollution is a global health threat that causes severe mortality and morbidity from respiratory, cardiovascular, and other diseases. Its impact is especially concerning in cities; as the urban population increases, especially in low- and middle-income countries, large populations risk suffering from these health effects. The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) comprises 15 West African countries, in which many cities are currently experiencing fast growth and industrialization. However, government-led initiatives in air quality monitoring are scarce in ECOWAS countries, which makes it difficult to effectively control and regulate air quality and subsequent health issues. A scoping study was performed following the Arksey and O’Malley methodological framework in order to assess the precise status of air quality monitoring, related policy, and legislation in this region. Scientific databases and gray literature searches were conducted, and the results were contrasted through expert consultations. It was found that only two ECOWAS countries monitor air quality, and most countries have insufficient legislation in place. Public health surveillance data in relation to air quality data is largely unavailable. In order to address this, improved air quality surveillance, stricter and better-enforced regulations, regional cooperation, and further research are strongly suggested for ECOWAS.},

Furthermore, the authors point to the practical advantages of conducting joint interviews with couples. In taking a relational view of the self and of what is produced in research interviews, the authors propose to apply the concept of family display, originally proposed by Janet Finch. It is argued that the researcher may be seen as one of many possible audiences for this type of family practice.},

	abstract = {Poor air quality is thought to be an important mortality risk factor globally1–3, but there is little direct evidence from the developing world on how mortality risk varies with changing exposure to ambient particulate matter. Current global estimates apply exposure–response relationships that have been derived mostly from wealthy, mid-latitude countries to spatial population data4, and these estimates remain unvalidated across large portions of the globe. Here we combine household survey-based information on the location and timing of nearly 1 million births across sub-Saharan Africa with satellite-based estimates5 of exposure to ambient respirable particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 μm (PM2.5) to estimate the impact of air quality on mortality rates among infants in Africa. We find that a 10 μg m−3 increase in PM2.5 concentration is associated with a 9\% (95\% confidence interval, 4–14\%) rise in infant mortality across the dataset. This effect has not declined over the last 15 years and does not diminish with higher levels of household wealth. Our estimates suggest that PM2.5 concentrations above minimum exposure levels were responsible for 22\% (95\% confidence interval, 9–35\%) of infant deaths in our 30 study countries and led to 449,000 (95\% confidence interval, 194,000–709,000) additional deaths of infants in 2015, an estimate that is more than three times higher than existing estimates that attribute death of infants to poor air quality for these countries2,6. Upward revision of disease-burden estimates in the studied countries in Africa alone would result in a doubling of current estimates of global deaths of infants that are associated with air pollution, and modest reductions in African PM2.5 exposures are predicted to have health benefits to infants that are larger than most known health interventions.},

	abstract = {An important aspect of the new sustainable development goals (SDGs) is a greater emphasis on reducing the health impacts from ambient air pollution in developing countries. Meanwhile, the burden of human disease attributable to ambient air pollution in sub-Saharan Africa is growing, yet estimates of its impact on the region are possibly underestimated due to a lack of air quality monitoring, a paucity of air pollution epidemiological studies, and important population vulnerabilities in the region. The lack of ambient air pollution epidemiologic data in sub-Saharan Africa is also an important global health disparity. Thousands of air pollution health effects studies have been conducted in Europe and North America, rather than in urban areas that have some of the highest measured air pollution levels in world, including urban areas in sub-Saharan Africa. In this paper, we provide a systematic and narrative review of the literature on ambient air pollution epidemiological studies that have been conducted in the region to date. Our review of the literature focuses on epidemiologic studies that measure air pollutants and relate air pollution measurements with various health outcomes. We highlight the gaps in ambient air pollution epidemiological studies conducted in different sub-regions of sub-Saharan Africa and provide methodological recommendations for future environmental epidemiology studies addressing ambient air pollution in the region.},

Currently, only 16\% of the organic P is recycled to agriculture. Chemical P fertiliser represents 66 \% of the P fertiliser used for crop production.

Annually, 9000 Mg of P is transferred to faecal matter, but none is recycled. Overall, Malawian soils have a negative P balance of -4000 Mg. Malawi can reduce its dependence on imported chemical P if recycling of organic P source is adopted. However, regulations should be put in place to control the quality of organic fertilisers.},

	abstract = {In urban Blantyre, there is ample green-waste and widespread interest in compost, but the feedstock is often contaminated with plastics. If composting is going to become more widely implemented, it must be profitable and ideally, competitive with chemical nutrients, however the time and cost associated with plastics removal is currently a bottleneck to profitability. In this study we investigated the financial sustainability of compost production using a Time-Driven Activity-Based Costing method over 16-weeks to identify the types and duration of each activity required. Combining these data with capital and operating costs, we then modeled the profitability of the facility to identify cost-bottlenecks and to determine scenarios that would lead to improved profitability. The results show that it took 1 h 50 min of labor to produce 165-L (0.065 m$^{\textrm{3}}$) bag of compost. A total of 12.3\% of the active labor time was spent sorting out plastics from the organic waste before composting, during composting and from the finished product before packaging. Until similar work is published on the topic, these values cannot be evaluated as being either optimal or wasteful, but rather, serve as a baseline against which future interventions—e.g., source separation, especially at markets can be evaluated. Though based in Malawi, the documented and modeled costs can be converted and scaled by other entrepreneurs/agencies who are interested in estimating the financial feasibility of composting in their own context.},
