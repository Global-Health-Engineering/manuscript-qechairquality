	abstract = {Recently, many researchers paid more attentions to the association between air pollution and respiratory system disease. In the past few years, levels of smog have increased throughout China resulting in the deterioration of air quality, raising worldwide concerns. PM2.5 (particles less than 2.5 micrometers in diameter) can penetrate deeply into the lung, irritate and corrode the alveolar wall, and consequently impair lung function. Hence it is important to investigate the impact of PM2.5 on the respiratory system and then to help China combat the current air pollution problems. In this review, we will discuss PM2.5 damage on human respiratory system from epidemiological, experimental and mechanism studies. At last, we recommend to the population to limit exposure to air pollution and call to the authorities to create an index of pollution related to health.},

These emissions, however, are not included in many current emission inventories used for chemistry and climate modeling applications. This paper presents the ﬁrst comprehensive and consistent estimates of the global emissions of greenhouse gases, particulate matter, reactive trace gases, and toxic compounds from open waste burning. Global emissions of CO2 from open waste burning are relatively small compared to total anthropogenic CO2; however, regional CO2 emissions, particularly in many developing countries in Asia and Africa, are substantial. Further, emissions of reactive trace gases and particulate matter from open waste burning are more signiﬁcant on regional scales. For example, the emissions of PM10 from open domestic waste burning in China is equivalent to 22\% of China’s total reported anthropogenic PM10 emissions. The results of the emissions model presented here suggest that emissions of many air pollutants are signiﬁcantly underestimated in current inventories because open waste burning is not included, consistent with studies that compare model results with available observations.},

The rapid pace of increase in population, economic growth, urbanization and industrialization is coupled with accelerated solid waste generation. In most of the developing countries wastes are either scattered in urban centers or disposed off unplanned in low lying areas or open dumps. The lack of infrastructure for collection, transportation, treatment and disposal of solid waste, proper solid waste management planning, insufﬁcient ﬁnancial resources, technical expertise and public attitude have made the situation exasperating due to which several environmental and health related problems are increasing. Though, there are many negative issues related to solid waste, it also provides many opportunities that not only mitigates its negative impact but also helps in meeting the demand for energy and employment generation as well as in soil health improvement. Keeping in mind the present situation the current review was planned with the objective to overlook the challenges and opportunities faced during urban solid waste management in developing countries like India.},

The results present that the major indicators had obvious regional differences, which can divide Africa into three levels: North Africa and South Africa {\textgreater} West Africa and Central Africa {\textgreater} East Africa. Besides, the disposal methods in North Africa, South Africa and West Africa have evolved from simple open dumping to sanitary landfill, composting and recycle treatment, while opening dumping is still rampant in East Africa. With a combination tool of Principal Component Analysis and Multiple Linear Regression, it was identified that eco­ nomic growth, urbanization and geographical location are the most critical factors influencing the unbalanced statue of MSW management in Africa.

	abstract = {Solid waste management remains a challenge globally attributed to several factors including inadequacies and ineffectiveness of policies. Presumably, good policies should translate to better solid waste management prac­ tices. However, other underlying factors and implementation challenges may determine the waste management status. Thus the debate in the literature on solid waste management policy and practice remains inconclusive. Based on literature review, this paper examines the discourse on solid waste management regulation and status in Sub-Saharan Africa. A paradox of policy outcomes is revealed at global and national level. Global policies have not been holistically contextualised and integrated in national policies. While national policies have not improved the solid waste management status of some countries, in others, it has, albeit unsustainably. Notably, inherent weaknesses such as insufficiency, homogeneity and ambiguity of policies affects implementation. This is exacerbated by poor enforcement strategies, lack of participatory mechanisms, inadequate sensitisation, influ­ ence of power and politics, as well as weak political commitment, among others. To ensure smart and clean cities, it is crucial for initiatives of solid waste management not only to be legally supported, but also contextualised and co-generated. For effective policy implementation, there is need for sensitisation of urban dwellers to enable comprehension of policies. Participatory strategies and governments’ commitment towards solid waste man­ agement should be paramount. Due to rapid changes in urban areas, periodic studies on content and context inferences such as solid waste collection practices and participation of actors in the informal settlements are required to dispel the practice of homogenising policies in order to enhance relevancy and suitability.},

@article{mohapatra2014effect,
	title = {Effect of {Particulate} {Matter} ({PM}) on plants, climate, ecosystems, and human health},
	abstract = {Particulate matter (PM) is a complex mixture of solid and liquid particles that are suspended in air. These particles typically consist of a mixture of inorganic and organic chemicals, including carbon, sulfates, nitrates, metals, acids, and semi-volatile compounds. The size of PM in air ranges from approximately 0.005 to 100 micrometers (µm) in diameter -- the size of just a few atoms to about the thickness of a human hair. Researchers have defined size categories for these particles differently. PM is defined by three general categories commonly used by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA): coarse (10 to 2.5 µm), fine (2.5 µm or smaller), and ultrafine (0.1 µm or smaller). Research suggests that particle size is an important factor that influences how particles deposit in the respiratory tract and affect human health. Coarse particles are deposited almost exclusively in the nose and throat; whereas, fine and ultrafine particles generally are able to penetrate to deep areas of the lung. Fine and ultrafine particles are present in greater numbers and have greater surface area than larger particles of the same mass, and they are generally considered to be more toxic. Most countries contribute to aiborne particulate matter pollution in other countries. In the past couple of years particulate matter has recieved media attention, concequential to the discovery of thousand of people dying young of particulate matter introduced health effects. This includes both short-term and long-term effects. Particulate matter does not only cause health effects, it also plays a role in the green house effect and global warming because of its contribution to cloud formation. Particulate matter is released from natural sources, such as volcanic eruptions, sea salt, or soils. Anthropogenic sources, such as car exhausts, industry, shipping and coal and ore fabrication, cause increases in airborne particulate matter concentrations on many locations. Deposition of these particulate matters on vegetated surfaces depend on the size distribution of these particles and effects of particulate matter on vegetation may be associated with the reduction in light required for photosynthesis and increase in leaf temperature due to changed surface optical properties.},

	abstract = {Ambient air pollution has been associated with adverse respiratory outcomes, especially among children with asthma. This study reports on associations between daily ambient air pollutant concentrations and the respiratory symptoms of schoolchildren living in Durban, South Africa. This city is Africa's busiest port and a key hub for imported crude oil and exported reﬁned petroleum and petrochemical products, and it experiences a mixture of air pollutants that reﬂects emissions from industry, trafﬁc and biomass burning. Children in four communities in the highly industrialized southern portion of the city were compared to children of similar socio-economic proﬁles living in the north of the city. One school was selected in each community. A total of 423 children were recruited. Symptom logs were completed every 1.5e2 h over 3-week period in each of four seasons. Ambient concentrations of NO2, NO, SO2, CO, O3, PM2.5 and PM10 were measured throughout the study. Generalized estimating equation (GEE) models were used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and assess lag effects (1e5 days) using single pollutant (single lags or distributed lags) models. Concentrations of SO2 and NOx were markedly higher in the south, while PM10 did not vary. Signiﬁcant increase in the odds ratios of cough were identiﬁed for the various lags analyzed. The OR of symptoms was further increased among those living in the south compared to the north. In conclusion, in this analysis of over 70,000 observations, we provide further evidence that exposure to PM10, SO2, NO2 and NO is associated with signiﬁcantly increased occurrence of respiratory symptoms among children. This was evident for cough, shortness of breath, and chest tightness, across the four pollutants and for different lags of exposure. This is the ﬁrst study describing these changes in sub-Saharan Africa.},

An analysis of literature on the work done and reported mainly in publications from 2005 to 2011, related to waste management in developing countries, showed that few articles give quantitative information. The analysis was conducted in two of the major scientiﬁc journals, Waste Management Journal and Waste Management and Research. The objective of this research was to determine the stakeholders’ action/behavior that have a role in the waste management process and to analyze inﬂuential factors on the system, in more than thirty urban areas in 22 developing countries in 4 continents. A combination of methods was used in this study in order to assess the stakeholders and the factors inﬂuencing the performance of waste management in the cities. Data was collected from scientiﬁc literature, existing data bases, observations made during visits to urban areas, structured interviews with relevant professionals, exercises provided to participants in workshops and a questionnaire applied to stakeholders. Descriptive and inferential statistic methods were used to draw conclusions. The outcomes of the research are a comprehensive list of stakeholders that are relevant in the waste management systems and a set of factors that reveal the most important causes for the systems’ failure. The information provided is very useful when planning, changing or implementing waste management systems in cities.},

This article assessed the current status of solid waste management in LDCs from waste generation to disposal. Solid waste generation in LDCs averages 0.56 kg/capita/day while the solid waste stream consists mainly of organics (52\%) followed by recyclables (26\%). Waste collection is also low and due to irregular waste collection, many people in LDCs resort to illegal practices such as illegal dumping or open burning of wastes. Sanitary landfilling is almost non-existent in LDCs with some of the few landfills present severely lacking in effective leachate or gas collection systems. While recycling is carried out in some LDCs, the most common practice is to collect recyclables for exportation. Similarly, composting of solid waste exists mainly on small-scale while biogas plants present in LDCs are used mostly for treatment of animal manure. Some of the challenges faced by LDCs include lack of funding, infrastructure, legislations, knowledge, and awareness on solid waste issues. However, there is a huge potential for job creation in the solid waste management field including waste collection, recycling, composting and even sanitary landfilling.},

Accordingly, the study revealed that the peak hour for high pollutant concentration emission ranges between 8 pm to 11 pm hours, and the mean air quality index was more than a moderate level. Particularly, on Hidar Sitaten in 2019 at 9 pm the maximum concentration of PM2.5 was 8.6 times higher than WHO air quality guideline standard of daily allowance. The highest mean of air quality index and concentration of PM2.5 recorded was 112 and 44.2 µg/m3 on 21 November 2017, respectively, and it was found to be unhealthy for sensitive groups. This implies that the concentration of PM2.5 was harmful to people who are unusually sensitive to particulate pollution and have health problems. Therefore, public participation and strong regulations are needed on air quality management to strike a balance between a cultural practice of Hidar Sitaten and healthy air quality.},

Industrial expansion in these cities is also a major contributor to the worsening air pollution. Exposure to ambient air pollution is a major threat to human health in SSA with 176,000 deaths and 626,000 DALYs in the region attributable to ambient air pollution exposure. These estimates are however likely to be much higher than reported due to the limited data emanating from the region. Recently, the adoption of the World Health Assembly resolution on air pollution and health, and Sustainable Development Goals are a welcome boost for urban air pollution control efforts in SSA. In this article, we have outlined within the broad framework of these international policy instruments, measures for addressing urban air pollution and its associated health impacts in SSA sustainably.},

	abstract = {Poor air quality is a development challenge. Urbanization and industrial development along with increased populations have brought clear socio-economic beneﬁts to Low-and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs) but can also bring disadvantages such as decreasing air quality. A lack of reliable air quality data in East African cities makes it difﬁcult to understand air pollution exposure and to predict future air quality trends. This work documents urban air quality and air pollution exposure in the capital cities of Kampala (Uganda), Addis Ababa (Ethiopia) and Nairobi (Kenya). We build a situational awareness of air pollution through repeated static and dynamic mobile monitoring in a range of urban locations, including urban background, roadside (pavement and building), rural background, and bus station sites, alongside vehicle-based measurements including buses and motorcycle taxis. Data suggest that the measured particulate matter mass concentrations (PM2.5, PM10) in all studied cities was at high concentrations, and often hazardous to human health, as deﬁned by WHO air quality guidelines. Overall, the poorest air quality was observed in Kampala, where mean daily PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations were signiﬁcantly above the WHO limits at urban background locations by 122\% and 69\% and at roadside locations by 193\% and 215\%, respectively. Trafﬁc is clearly a major contributor to East African urban air pollution; monitoring in Kampala and Addis Ababa, on motorcycle taxis, in buses and at bus stations indicated that drivers and commuters were exposed to poor air quality throughout their commute. Road-related air pollution can also impact indoor locations near roads. Using one exemplar building located within Nairobi’s Central Business District, it is shown that measured outdoor PM concentrations signiﬁcantly correlate with the indoor air quality (r=0.84). This link between roadside emissions and indoor air pollution within buildings located close to the road should be explored more fully. This study, through a series of case studies, provides clear evidence that roads and trafﬁc need to be a focus for mitigation strategies to reduce air pollution exposure in East African cities.},

	abstract = {Introduction
              Air and noise pollution are emerging environmental health hazards in African cities, with potentially complex spatial and temporal patterns. Limited local data are a barrier to the formulation and evaluation of policies to reduce air and noise pollution.
            
            
              Methods and analysis
              
                We designed a year-long measurement campaign to characterise air and noise pollution and their sources at high-resolution within the Greater Accra Metropolitan Area (GAMA), Ghana. Our design uses a combination of fixed (year-long, n=10) and rotating (week-long, n ={\textasciitilde}130) sites, selected to represent a range of land uses and source influences (eg, background, road traffic, commercial, industrial and residential areas, and various neighbourhood socioeconomic classes). We will collect data on fine particulate matter (PM
                2.5
                ), nitrogen oxides (NO
                x
                ), weather variables, sound (noise level and audio) along with street-level time-lapse images. We deploy low-cost, low-power, lightweight monitoring devices that are robust, socially unobtrusive, and able to function in Sub-Saharan African (SSA) climate. We will use state-of-the-art methods, including spatial statistics, deep/machine learning, and processed-based emissions modelling, to capture highly resolved temporal and spatial variations in pollution levels across the GAMA and to identify their potential sources. This protocol can serve as a prototype for other SSA cities.
              
            
            
              Ethics and dissemination
              This environmental study was deemed exempt from full ethics review at Imperial College London and the University of Massachusetts Amherst; it was approved by the University of Ghana Ethics Committee (ECH 149/18-19). This protocol is designed to be implementable in SSA cities to map environmental pollution to inform urban planning decisions to reduce health harming exposures to air and noise pollution. It will be disseminated through local stakeholder engagement (public and private sectors), peer-reviewed publications, contribution to policy documents, media, and conference presentations.},

	abstract = {Ambient air pollution in urban cities in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is an important public health problem with models and limited monitoring data indicating high concentrations of pollutants such as ﬁne particulate matter (PM2.5). On most global air quality index maps, however, information about ambient pollution from SSA is scarce. We evaluated the feasibility and practicality of longitudinal measurements of ambient PM2.5 using low-cost air quality sensors (Purple Air-II-SD) across thirteen locations in seven countries in SSA. Devices were used to gather data over a 30-day period with the aim of assessing the eﬃciency of its data recovery rate and identifying challenges experienced by users in each location. The median data recovery rate was 94\% (range: 72\% to 100\%). The mean 24 h concentration measured across all sites was 38 µg/m3 with the highest PM2.5 period average concentration of 91 µg/m3 measured in Kampala, Uganda and lowest concentrations of 15 µg/m3 measured in Faraja, The Gambia. Kampala in Uganda and Nnewi in Nigeria recorded the longest periods with concentrations {\textgreater}250 µg/m3. Power outages, SD memory card issues, internet connectivity problems and device safety concerns were important challenges experienced when using Purple Air-II-SD sensors. Despite some operational challenges, this study demonstrated that it is reasonably practicable and feasible to establish a network of low-cost devices to provide data on local PM2.5 concentrations in SSA countries. Such data are crucially needed to raise public, societal and policymaker awareness about air pollution across SSA.},

	abstract = {Objective—To examine associations between ambient air pollutants and respiratory outcomes among schoolchildren in Durban, South Africa.
Methods—Primary schools from within each of seven communities in two regions of Durban (the highly industrialised south compared with the non-industrial north) were selected. Children from randomly selected grade 4 classrooms were invited to participate. Standardised interviews, spirometry, methacholine challenge testing and skin-prick testing were conducted. Particulate matter (PM), sulphur dioxide (SO2) and carbon monoxide were monitored at each school, while nitrogen oxides (NOx) and other pollutants were monitored at other sites.
Results—SO2 was significantly higher in the south than in the north, while PM concentrations were similar across the city. The prevalence of symptoms consistent with asthma of any severity was 32.1\%. Covariate-adjusted prevalences were higher among children from schools in the south than among those from the north for persistent asthma (12.2\% v. 9.6 \%) and for marked airway hyperreactivity (AHR) (8.1\% v. 2.8\%), while SO2 resulted in a twofold increased risk of marked AHR (95\% confidence interval 0.98 – 4.66; p=0.056).
Conclusions—Schoolchildren from industrially exposed communities experienced higher covariate-adjusted prevalences of persistent asthma and marked AHR than children from communities distant from industrial sources. Our findings are strongly suggestive of industrial pollution-related adverse respiratory health effects among these children.},

	abstract = {In urban Blantyre, there is ample green-waste and widespread interest in compost, but the feedstock is often contaminated with plastics. If composting is going to become more widely implemented, it must be profitable and ideally, competitive with chemical nutrients, however the time and cost associated with plastics removal is currently a bottleneck to profitability. In this study we investigated the financial sustainability of compost production using a Time-Driven Activity-Based Costing method over 16-weeks to identify the types and duration of each activity required. Combining these data with capital and operating costs, we then modeled the profitability of the facility to identify cost-bottlenecks and to determine scenarios that would lead to improved profitability. The results show that it took 1 h 50 min of labor to produce 165-L (0.065 m$^{\textrm{3}}$) bag of compost. A total of 12.3\% of the active labor time was spent sorting out plastics from the organic waste before composting, during composting and from the finished product before packaging. Until similar work is published on the topic, these values cannot be evaluated as being either optimal or wasteful, but rather, serve as a baseline against which future interventions—e.g., source separation, especially at markets can be evaluated. Though based in Malawi, the documented and modeled costs can be converted and scaled by other entrepreneurs/agencies who are interested in estimating the financial feasibility of composting in their own context.},
